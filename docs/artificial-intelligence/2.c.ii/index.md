# 2.c.ii - Algorithmic Justice

* * *

Section 2.c.i showed that are many definitions of algorithmic fairness.

At any level, it is impossible to achieve all the definitions simultaneously. Deciding between which fairness definition to satisfy requires normative decision-making, moving from pursuing algorithmic fairness into a more holistic idea of algorithmic justice.

Algorithmic justice isn’t achieved by merely satisfying specific statistical definitions of fairness. 

Instead, algorithmic justice methodologies decenter purely technical analysis of algorithms, inputs, and outputs and emphasizes [**social and political factors and approaches**](javascript:openPanel('sociopolitical-factors-and-approaches')).

More reductively:

Algorithmic Fairness + Social Justice = Algorithmic Justice

We can understand “justice” through the lens of various philosophical definitions paired with real world case studies from multiple disciplines.

### Justice as recognition
    
The [**recognition dimension of justice**](javascript:openPanel('failures-of-recognition')) focuses on how automated decision systems affect how individuals and groups relate to each other on an interpersonal level.

Injustice under the recognition dimension can manifest through technologies that deny or question the equal social worth or standing of individuals in social (often more informal) interactions.
    
For example, automated technologies like search engines often produce outputs that mirror biases and stereotypes, thus reinforcing and promoting such attitudes and behaviors in users in the long term. These outputs have increased with the advent of generative AI techniques like  image generation, image captioning, and text generation.

### Justice as distribution

The [**distribution dimension of justice**](javascript:openPanel('failures-of-distribution')) examines how systems affect the **distribution** of assets and opportunities across society. Below are three ideas on how to to achieve just distribution:

1. Justice as **sufficiency**: set a common baseline of access to essential assets for a decent/good life (e.g., housing, employment, health, basic means of subsistence, UBI)

2. Justice as **priority**: do the most for the worst off – those who are worst off should get priority in the distribution of assets and certainly should not suffer additional adverse consequences as a result of their situation

3. **Equality of opportunity**: morally irrelevant characteristics  should not disadvantage your capacity to lead a decent/good life and access the assets required for it (jobs, healthcare, education, etc.) must not be shaped by disadvantages which are beyond their control (e.g., they must not be discriminated on the basis of characteristics they have no agency over, such as sex/gender, race, their parent’s background, the environment they grew up in …)
