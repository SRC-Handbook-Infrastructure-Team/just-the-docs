# Names 
- Responsible AI
- Trustworthy AI
- AI Governance
- Human Centered AI
- AI Safety
- AI Ethics

These terms do not have universally agreed upon definitions. Stakeholder groups use them in different contexts (naming organizations, centers, initiatives, projects, etc.) depending on their own values and priorities. Thus, this database does not subscribe to one name on the list. Instead, it focuses directly on 3 subtopics often discussed within those spaces: fairness & justice, transparency, and reliability.
